## Examples of Solved Problems:

### Example 1

**Question**: Let \\[f(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n4n+3 &\\text{if }n<a, \\\\\n7n-12 &\\text{if }n\\ge{a}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]Find $a$ if the graph of $y=f(n)$ is continuous.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**: 

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - The function \( f(n) \) is piecewise defined as:
     \[
     f(n) =
     \begin{cases}
     4n + 3 & \text{if } n < a, \\
     7n - 12 & \text{if } n \geq a.
     \end{cases}
     \]
   - For the graph of \( f(n) \) to be continuous, the two parts of the function must meet at \( n = a \), i.e., \( \lim_{n \to a^-} f(n) = \lim_{n \to a^+} f(n) \).

2. **Set up the continuity condition:**
   - The left-hand part of the function is \( 4n + 3 \) (valid for \( n < a \)), and the right-hand part is \( 7n - 12 \) (valid for \( n \geq a \)).
   - At \( n = a \), we require:
     \[
     4a + 3 = 7a - 12.
     \]

3. **Solve for \( a \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4a + 3 = 7a - 12.
     \]
   - Rearrange terms:
     \[
     3 + 12 = 7a - 4a \quad \Rightarrow \quad 15 = 3a.
     \]
   - Divide through by 3:
     \[
     a = 5.
     \]

4. **Verify continuity:**
   - Substituting \( a = 5 \):
     - For \( n < 5 \), \( f(5) = 4(5) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23 \).
     - For \( n \geq 5 \), \( f(5) = 7(5) - 12 = 35 - 12 = 23 \).
   - The values agree at \( n = 5 \), confirming continuity.

**Answer**: 5


### Example 2

**Question**: ### Story Rule:\n\nIn the Transformers universe, the origins of the Autobots and Decepticons trace back to their home planet Cybertron, a metallic world inhabited by sentient robots capable of transformation. Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.\n\n### Question:\nHow are leaders elected?\nOptions: A. By democratic election ##B. By leadership matrix or by strength and intimidation ## C. Selection by lottery ##D. Random selection

**Step-by-step reasoning:**:

1. **Understand the leadership selection process for each faction:**
   - For the Autobots, leaders are chosen by the **Matrix of Leadership**, a powerful artifact that is passed down from one leader to another. This symbolizes democracy and elite governance.
   - For the Decepticons, leaders rise to power through **strength and intimidation**, reflecting their belief in "survival of the fittest."

2. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A:** "By democratic election" — This is incorrect because Autobots do not use a voting system. The Matrix of Leadership is the deciding factor.
   - **Option B:** "By leadership matrix or by strength and intimidation" — This correctly reflects the leadership selection processes for both Autobots and Decepticons.
   - **Option C:** "Selection by lottery" — There is no indication that leaders are chosen randomly.
   - **Option D:** "Random selection" — This is similar to Option C and does not align with the detailed selection methods described.

3. **Determine the best fit:**
   - The correct answer must encompass both methods of leader selection as described.

**Answer**: [[B]]
