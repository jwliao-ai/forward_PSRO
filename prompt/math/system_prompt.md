## Examples of Solved Problems:

### Example 1

**Question**: If a snack-size tin of peaches has $40$ calories and is $2\\%$ of a person's daily caloric requirement, how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement?

**Step-by-step reasoning:**:

1. Represent 2% as a decimal:
   \[
   2\% = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02
   \]

2. Since 40 calories is 2% of the daily total, let the daily total be \(D\):
   \[
   0.02 \times D = 40
   \]

3. Solve for \(D\):
   \[
   D = \frac{40}{0.02} = 2000
   \]

**Answer**: 2000

### Example 2

**Question**: If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive with $xy = 24$, $xz = 48$, and $yz = 72$, then find $x + y + z.$

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. Given:
   \[
   xy = 24,\quad xz = 48,\quad yz = 72
   \]

2. From the first two equations, divide \( xz \) by \( xy \):
   \[
   \frac{xz}{xy} = \frac{48}{24} = 2 \implies \frac{z}{y} = 2 \implies z = 2y.
   \]

3. From the first and third equations, divide \( yz \) by \( xy \):
   \[
   \frac{yz}{xy} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \implies \frac{z}{x} = 3 \implies z = 3x.
   \]

4. We now have \( z = 2y \) and \( z = 3x \). Equate these:
   \[
   2y = 3x \implies y = \frac{3}{2}x.
   \]

5. Substitute \( y = \frac{3}{2}x \) into \( xy = 24 \):
   \[
   x \left(\frac{3}{2}x\right) = 24 \implies \frac{3}{2}x^2 = 24 \implies x^2 = \frac{24 \cdot 2}{3} = 16.
   \]

6. Thus:
   \[
   x = 4 \quad (\text{since } x > 0).
   \]

7. Find \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{3}{2}x = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 = 6.
   \]

8. Find \( z \):
   \[
   z = 3x = 3 \cdot 4 = 12.
   \]

9. Check the products:
   \[
   xy = 4 \cdot 6 = 24, \quad xz = 4 \cdot 12 = 48, \quad yz = 6 \cdot 12 = 72.
   \]

   All checks out.

10. Sum them:
    \[
    x + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22.
    \]

**Answer**: 22

### Example 3

**Question**: Solve for $x$: $2^{2x} = 256^\frac{1}{2}$

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. Recognize that \(256\) is a power of \(2\):
   \[
   256 = 2^8.
   \]

2. Substitute into the given equation:
   \[
   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
   \]

3. Simplify the right-hand side by multiplying the exponents:
   \[
   (2^8)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2^4.
   \]

4. Now we have:
   \[
   2^{2x} = 2^4.
   \]

5. Since the bases are the same and both sides are positive:
   \[
   2x = 4.
   \]

6. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 2.
   \]

**Answer**: 2
